## Inofficial Nori Version 2, including some backports from v1

This is an inofficial fork of ["Nori: An educational ray tracer"](https://github.com/wjakob/nori) that includes backports from [version 1](https://github.com/wjakob/nori-old), to remove some of the startup overhead of implementing basic primitives such as ray tracing. While this allows programmings assignments to put more focus on higher-level light transport algorithms, we still encourage you to replace the given default implementations with your own toy implementations in order to advance your own practical skills.
